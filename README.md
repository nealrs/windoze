## WINDOZE

This (unpacked) Chrome extension adds a persistent sidebar with a collapsible tree view of your browser windows & tabs.

### What it does
- Shows all open windows, their tabs, and tab groups in a collapsible tree.
- Lets you rename windows for easier identification.
- Lets you switch focus between windows and tabs from the sidebar.
- Provides a lightweight, hackable UI for browsing and reorganizing your open tabs.

### How to install
1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right).
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder for this extension (the folder that contains `manifest.json`, `background.js`, `script.js`, etc.).
4. The extension should appear in the list. Pin it or open the sidebar as needed.

### Misc
- Repository contains the extension source (manifest, scripts, styles, icons). It's not packaged for the Chrome Web Store.
- This software is provided with absolutely zero support.
- I'm not licensing this, because frankly, Gemini Pro 2.5 wrote this, I just prompted some instructions and did some debugging in a loop.
